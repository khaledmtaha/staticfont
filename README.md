# Variable Font to Static Font Converter

This Python script automates the process of converting variable fonts (.ttf) to multiple static font instances. It's designed to process all variable fonts in a specified directory, creating static instances for predefined or custom weight values.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Font Processing**: Place your variable font files (.ttf) in the `fonts/` folder, and the script will automatically detect and process them.
- **Intelligent Output**: The script creates an output folder for each processed font, naming it after the original font file.
- **Batch Processing**: Converts multiple variable fonts in a single run.
- **Customizable Weights**: Define custom weight values via a configuration file.

## Virtual Environment Setup (Strongly Recommended)

It's strongly recommended to use a virtual environment for this project. This isolates the project dependencies from your global Python installation. Here's how to set it up:

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
2. Create a virtual environment (replace `<your-venv-name>` with your preferred name, e.g., 'font_env'):
   ```
   python -m venv <your-venv-name>
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     <your-venv-name>\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source <your-venv-name>/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Place your variable font files (.ttf) in the `fonts/` directory.
2. **Processing**: Run the script. It automatically detects and processes all .ttf files in the input directory.
3. **Output**: For each input font, the script creates a dedicated output folder named after the font. Inside this folder, you'll find the generated static font instances.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed and have set up and activated your virtual environment as described above.
2. Place your variable font files in the `fonts/` directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python src/scripts/variable_to_static_font_converter.py
   ```
4. Check the `fonts/output/` directory for your converted fonts. Each font will have its own subfolder.

## Example

If you place `MyFont-Variable.ttf` in the `fonts/` directory and run the script, you'll find the output in `fonts/output/MyFont-Variable/`, containing files like:
- `MyFont-Variable-Thin.ttf`
- `MyFont-Variable-Regular.ttf`
- `MyFont-Variable-Bold.ttf`
(Exact output files depend on the weight configurations)

## Configuration

You can customize the weight values by modifying the `config.json` file in the script's directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- fonttools
